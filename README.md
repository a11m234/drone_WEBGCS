## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up all components of the GCS.

### 1. PX4-Autopilot Installation

First, install PX4-Autopilot SITL (Software In The Loop) for drone simulation.

1.  **Follow the Ubuntu development environment setup instructions:**
    It is crucial to set up your environment correctly for PX4. Please visit and follow the detailed instructions at:
    [PX4 Development Environment Setup (Linux/Ubuntu)](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_setup/dev_env_linux_ubuntu.html)

2.  **Clone and build PX4-Autopilot:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git)
    cd PX4-Autopilot
    bash ./Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh
    ```

### 2. MAVSDK Installation

MAVSDK is used for communicating with the PX4 autopilot.

1.  **Clone MAVSDK repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK)
    cd MAVSDK
    ```
2.  **Initialize and update submodules:**
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
3.  **Build MAVSDK:**
    ```bash
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_MAVSDK_SERVER=YES -Bbuild/default -H.
    cmake --build build/default -j8
    ```

### 3. gRPC Bridge Setup

The gRPC Bridge acts as an intermediary, exposing MAVSDK functionalities via a RESTful API.

1.  **Navigate to your gRPC Bridge directory:**
    Assuming your project structure places `gRPCBridge` inside `DHGCS`:
    ```bash
    cd DHGCS/gRPCBridge/
    ```
2.  **Clone MAVSDK-Proto repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Proto](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Proto)
    ```
3.  **Install required npm packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install @grpc/grpc-js cors express
    ```

### 4. Web Application Setup

This section sets up the React-based user interface.

1.  **Navigate to your DHGCS directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DHGCS
    ```
2.  **Create a new React application:**
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app your-app-name # Replace 'your-app-name' with your desired app name
    ```
3.  **Navigate into the source directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-app-name/src
    ```

#### File Replacements

Replace the following files in `your-app-name/src` with the versions from this repository:

* `App.css`
* `App.js`

Additionally, copy the entire `components` folder from this repository into `your-app-name/src`.

#### Install Additional Requirements

1.  **Return to the app's root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Install `styled-components`:**
    ```bash
    npm install styled-components
    ```
3.  **Install any other dependencies that show up as errors during runtime:**
    If you encounter `Cannot find module 'some-package'` errors when running the app, install the missing package:
    ```bash
    npm install [package-name]
    ```

---

## Running the Complete System

To run the full GCS system, you will need **4 separate terminal windows** open simultaneously.

### Terminal 1: PX4 SITL

Start the PX4 simulator with the x500 drone model.
```bash
cd PX4-Autopilot
make px4_sitl gz_x500
````

### Terminal 2: MAVSDK Server

Launch the MAVSDK server, connecting to PX4 via UDP and exposing a gRPC port.

```bash
cd MAVSDK
./build/default/src/mavsdk_server/src/mavsdk_server udp://:14550 -p 50000
```

### Terminal 3: gRPC Bridge

Start the Node.js gRPC bridge which serves as the backend for your web application.

```bash
cd DHGCS/gRPCBridge
node ./src/mavsdk-rest.js
```

### Terminal 4: React Web Application

Launch the React development server for your GCS web interface.

```bash
cd DHGCS/your-app-name # Ensure you are in the 'your-app-name' directory
npm start
```

## Verification Steps

After starting all components, check each terminal and your browser for successful operation:

  * **Terminal 1 (PX4 SITL):** Should display messages indicating the simulation is running, and the drone is ready.
  * **Terminal 2 (MAVSDK Server):** Should show connection status messages (e.g., "Mavsdk server started," "Connected to UDP client").
  * **Terminal 3 (gRPC Bridge):** Should output messages confirming the server has started and is listening.
  * **Terminal 4 (React Development Server):** Should indicate that the development server has successfully launched and automatically open your default web browser.
  * **Web Browser:** Should automatically open to `localhost:3000`.
  * **Browser Console:** Open your browser's developer console (F12) and check for any errors. If the components are communicating correctly, you should see data flowing from the backend.

-----

## Troubleshooting

  * **Web application fails to start (`react-scripts: not found` or similar):** Ensure all npm dependencies are installed by running `npm install` in the `your-app-name` directory. If issues persist, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and reinstalling.
  * **Port Conflicts:** Verify that ports `14550` (PX4/MAVSDK), `50000` (MAVSDK server), and `3000` (React app) are available and not in use by other applications.
  * **MAVSDK server not connecting to PX4 SITL:** Check the output in Terminal 1 and 2 for any error messages related to connection. Ensure PX4 SITL is fully loaded before starting the MAVSDK server.
  * **File Copying Issues:** Double-check that all specified repository files (`App.css`, `App.js`, and the `components` folder) are correctly copied and placed in their respective `your-app-name/src` directories.
  * **New Dependency Errors:** If you encounter `Cannot find module 'package-name'` errors during runtime, install the missing package using `npm install [package-name]`.
